### Product Description

Channel Vertex Pro is a custom indicator designed to identify price channels and triangle patterns in the Forex market. It provides traders with valuable insights into potential price movements and can be used as a tool for making trading decisions.

The Channel Vertex Pro indicator offers the following features:

- Calculation of price channels: The indicator calculates the upper and lower boundaries of a price channel for a specified period. This helps traders identify potential support and resistance levels.

- Calculation of triangle patterns: The indicator also identifies triangle patterns in the price chart. It looks for three consecutive higher highs or lower lows to determine the existence of a triangle pattern. The indicator marks the highest vertex of the triangle pattern with an arrow.

To use the Channel Vertex Pro indicator, simply attach it to your chart in MetaTrader 5. You can customize the parameters of the indicator, such as the period for calculating the price channel and triangle pattern.

   - Sets up the indicator buffers for storing the calculated values.
   - Defines the index styles for displaying the price channels and triangle pattern.
   - Sets the index labels and draw begin points for the indicator.
   - Returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` to indicate successful initialization.

2. **Iteration Function (`OnCalculate()`):**
   - Receives the necessary data for calculating the indicator.
   - Calculates the price channel by finding the highest high and lowest low for a specified period.
   - Stores the calculated values in the `UpperChannel` and `LowerChannel` buffers.
   - Calculates the triangle pattern by finding the highest vertex for the last three bars.
   - Stores the highest vertex values in the `TriangleVertexes` buffer.
   - Returns the total number of rates to indicate the completion of calculation.
